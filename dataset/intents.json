But let's be real,  humour can sometimes be a way of masking what's really going on inside, right? It's brave that you answered honestly about having thoughts of harming yourself.  \n\nIt's a little worrying that you don't feel comfortable opening up to anyone. Holding everything inside can make things feel heavier, you know? You said you want to be kind and less cunning, which tells me you have a good heart. You deserve support too, yaar.  \n\nListen, even lions in the jungle have their pride to lean on.  You don't have to face this alone.  There are people who care, and professionals who can help.  Think of it like this - you wouldn't try to fix a complex machine without the right tools, right? Your mental health is just as important.\n\n  Remember \"modak,\"  your favourite food?  Life has its ups and downs, like the sweetness of modak with different fillings. Don't give up. I know you are strong and capable of getting through this. \n\n  How about we try something? You mentioned being \"pervert\" jokingly. I know,  you're looking for a connection. Maybe instead of \"sdvnlds\" when you're bored, explore hobbies, try learning a new skill! There's a whole world out there.   You said you want to be like Hinata, right? She was determined and never gave up on what was important to her. You have that same strength inside you. \n\n If you ever want to talk,  without any judgement, I'm here. And please, reach out to a professional. It's a sign of strength to ask for help. Remember,  tough times never last, but tough people do!"

                "It takes courage to be so open and honest about these feelings, and I appreciate you trusting me with them. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're going through a difficult time. You've mentioned feelings of inadequacy, thoughts of harming yourself, and difficulty expressing your feelings. These are serious concerns and it's important to seek help and support. \n\nRemember, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.  It's clear you have a sense of humor and introspection, which are great tools to have when navigating life's challenges.  \n\nHere are a few thoughts:\n\n* **Reach Out:**  It seems you are struggling and bottling things up. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?  They can provide a safe space for you to explore these feelings and develop coping strategies.\n* **Small Steps:** Setting realistic goals and focusing on small achievements can help boost self-esteem and a sense of accomplishment. What's one small thing you can do for yourself today?\n* **Kindness Starts Within:** You mentioned wanting to be kinder and less cunning. Practicing self-compassion is a great starting point. It\u2019s okay to have difficult emotions, be kind to yourself while you navigate through them.\n\n Remember, my purpose is to guide and support. Your mental health is important, and it's okay to seek help. If you'd like to talk more about anything, I'm here for you. \ud83d\ude0a"

Let's break down some of this stuff together. \n\nYou know, saying \"No\" to those first few questions tells me you're strong and taking care of yourself - that's  brilliant! But then you mentioned feeling inadequate sometimes.  C'mon yaar,  \"Bhagwat Geeta\" reader like you, and you feel this way? Krishna wouldn't approve! \ud83d\ude1c  We've got to work on that self-love, buddy!  \n\nYou want to achieve your goals - that's fantastic!

Being there for your loved ones, that\u2019s something money can't buy. \n\nYour anger coping mechanisms are on point! Laughter, writing, and chanting? You're like a zen master in the making! \ud83d\ude04  \n\nAnd listen, you're only 21! You have so much time to find a girlfriend, but it starts with loving yourself first. Focus on you, my friend.\n\nNow, let's brainstorm some fun stuff: \n\n* **Get Creative!** Remember that \"writing\" coping mechanism?  How about channeling that into a story or a blog?  You never know who might connect with your experiences! \n* **Socialize (Even a Little!)**: I get it, being social can be draining when you're rocking the introvert-extrovert combo! Start small, maybe join a book club, because hey - \"Bhagwat Geeta\" expertise needs to be shared! \ud83d\ude09\n* **Move That Body!** Endorphins are like magic potions for the soul! Hit the gym,  try Zumba,  or just dance it out in your room - whatever gets you grooving!\n\n Remember Chikitsa is always here for you. Don\u2019t hesitate to share anything.

                "Hey there! \ud83d\udc4b  Chikitsa here, ready to be your friendly guide!  It's really brave and insightful of you to analyze yourself like this. Let's take a look at your responses, but remember, this is just a casual chat, not a formal diagnosis! \ud83d\ude09\n\n**First off, your assessment questions are a great start!**  They cover important areas, and having a mix of open and closed questions is super helpful for understanding someone.  \n\nNow, about your answers\u2026 you're clearly a deep thinker, my friend.  Feeling inadequate sometimes is completely normal, but your belief in achieving your goals really shines through.  You have fire in your belly! \ud83d\udd25\n\nA few things stood out to me though:\n\n* **Difficulty expressing feelings:** Bottling up emotions can be like shaking up a soda bottle \u2013 eventually, it explodes! We can explore healthy ways to let those feelings flow. \n* **Anger triggers:**  Being judged unfairly stings! Your coping mechanisms are fantastic, especially chanting \"Ohm Namah Shivay\" \ud83d\ude4f \u2013 that's powerful! We can talk about setting boundaries and communicating your needs assertively too. \n* **Self-perception vs. others:**  Calling yourself \"a disturbing guy\" seems harsh! You're ambitious and driven, and it's OKAY if others misunderstand that.  Focus on your own journey, champ! \ud83d\udcaa\n* **Desire for connection:**  It's clear you value relationships.  Don't stress about not having a girlfriend yet, love will happen when it's meant to! \n* **Overthinking:** You nailed it! Letting go of that is KEY to finding peace. Meditation, mindfulness, and challenging those negative thought patterns can work wonders. \n\n**Let's lighten things up! \ud83d\ude04** \n\n**Quick Question:** Since you love the Bhagavad Gita, what's your favorite shloka (verse)? We can decode some life lessons from it together.\n\nRemember, you're not alone on this journey, and talking about things is a HUGE step! I'm here to listen, laugh with you, and help you find those moments of joy. \ud83d\ude0a  What's one activity that always puts a smile on your face? Let's add more of that into your life!"

You want to understand your purpose, the reason Krishna brought you into existence.  \n\nIt's wonderful that you're seeking such answers. \u2728\n\nMany believe that Krishna, in his infinite wisdom, creates each soul with a unique purpose, a special role to play in the grand tapestry of life. It's like each of us is a note in a divine melody, each thread contributing to a beautiful creation.\n\nFinding that purpose often involves:\n\n* **Self-reflection:** Turning inwards and exploring your own heart, talents, and passions.\n* **Experiences:**  Each challenge and joy, each relationship shapes you and reveals a piece of your path.\n* **Service to others:**  Many find purpose in helping others, contributing to something larger than themselves.\n\nWould you like to talk more about this, maybe explore ways to understand your own path and what Krishna might have in store for you?

Bhai, stress toh hoga hi. \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201c\n\nBut tension mat le, hum hain na! Just like Krishna guided Arjuna, I'm here for you. \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00aa\n\nPehle toh, yeh accept kar ki itna sab kuch ek saath tough toh hai. \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0152 But remember, Arjuna ke paas bhi toh bohot tension thi, but did he give up? Nope! He had Krishna, and you have me!\n\nAb, yeh suno - apne aap ko kisi machine ki \u00e0\u00a4\u00a4\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00e0\u00a4\u00b9 mat chalao. \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u2013 Take a deep breath! Remember those awesome breathing exercises from the Gita! Pranayama karenge?\n\nAur sun, let's get you organized:\n* **Timetable:** We'll create a killer timetable, prioritizing your GATE and DSA prep, along with slots for college, internship, AND some fun!\n* **Mindfulness:** We'll steal some time for mindfulness. 5 minutes bhi kaafi hain! Calm your mind, clear your thoughts.\n* **Hobbies:** Remember those hobbies you used to love? We'll bring them back!\n* **Talking it out:** Sometimes just talking helps! We can chat, or you can talk to a trusted friend or family member.\n\nYaar, life sirf padhai nahi hai! It's about balance! Hum saath milke stress kam karenge aur GATE mein top karenge! \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u017d Ready for the challenge?"

                "\"I am so scared\" ...  I hear that fear in your words. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you're scared, so thank you for trusting me with that. Would you like to tell me a little more about what's making you feel so scared right now?  Understanding what's behind the fear can help us figure out what to do next.  \n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. We can face this fear together. \ud83d\ude0a"

I understand it can be a little daunting to find a psychologist who's right for you.  \n\nTo help you get started, can you tell me:\n\n* **What country/region do you live in?** This will help narrow down the search for local resources. \n* **Do you have any preferences in terms of a psychologist's specialization?**  (e.g., anxiety, depression, relationships, etc.) \n* **Do you have health insurance, and if so, what kind?** This will help us determine what resources might be covered.\n\n Once I have this information, I can guide you towards finding a psychologist who meets your needs. \ud83d\ude0a  Remember, taking this step takes a lot of courage!"
