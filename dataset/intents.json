You want to understand your purpose, the reason Krishna brought you into existence.  \n\nIt's wonderful that you're seeking such answers. \u2728\n\nMany believe that Krishna, in his infinite wisdom, creates each soul with a unique purpose, a special role to play in the grand tapestry of life. It's like each of us is a note in a divine melody, each thread contributing to a beautiful creation.\n\nFinding that purpose often involves:\n\n* **Self-reflection:** Turning inwards and exploring your own heart, talents, and passions.\n* **Experiences:**  Each challenge and joy, each relationship shapes you and reveals a piece of your path.\n* **Service to others:**  Many find purpose in helping others, contributing to something larger than themselves.\n\nWould you like to talk more about this, maybe explore ways to understand your own path and what Krishna might have in store for you? Remember, I'm here as your friend and guide. \ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\ude4f"

                "\"I am so scared\" ...  I hear that fear in your words. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you're scared, so thank you for trusting me with that. Would you like to tell me a little more about what's making you feel so scared right now?  Understanding what's behind the fear can help us figure out what to do next.  \n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. We can face this fear together. \ud83d\ude0a"

I understand it can be a little daunting to find a psychologist who's right for you.  \n\nTo help you get started, can you tell me:\n\n* **What country/region do you live in?** This will help narrow down the search for local resources. \n* **Do you have any preferences in terms of a psychologist's specialization?**  (e.g., anxiety, depression, relationships, etc.) \n* **Do you have health insurance, and if so, what kind?** This will help us determine what resources might be covered.\n\n Once I have this information, I can guide you towards finding a psychologist who meets your needs. \ud83d\ude0a  Remember, taking this step takes a lot of courage!"
